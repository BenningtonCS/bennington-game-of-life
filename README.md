# Bennington Game of Life

###### Rough Steps to deploy on localhost/replicate:
- Have python installed
- clone repo into directory
- run `pip install virtualenv` 
- Go up one folder and run `virtualenv ENV` (ENV is just the name of the virtual environment that will contain the project's dependencies)
- run `ENV/Scripts/activate` and cd to the repo again
- run `pip install requirements.txt`(Install all the dependencies in your virtual environment)
- run `python manage.py runserver`

##Boom you should be live at local host or 127.0.0.1:8000.
